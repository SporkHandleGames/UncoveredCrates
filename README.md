# The Uncovered Crates
The Uncovered Crates was a game I was working on with a few people but after working with them for so long (about around a year) they never helped with the game development. They just told me what to do. My mom was paying for them to help me but it was all a big waste of time and money. The people I was working with was a game lesson company that my mom payed for me to go to but after everything around a year of work and I barely got anything done I'm so sorry for hyping up this game. From now on this game will not be worked on and I will be making another game by myself so I hope you know this wont happen again. When you download the game you will notice how unfinished the game is and how bad it is. Here is the year worth of work.

(by the way the monster in the game is called "Ycul" I'm planning on using him in another game in the future.)
